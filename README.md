Discuss what you learned in this (a) COVID-19 web app project and (b) Web Development 1 Course/Subject.  
  (a)
    - I have learned how crucial a front-end developer role is. It has to meet the design conditions and also set some limits to 
      what design can only be allowed in the project.
      
  (b)
    - I have learned the basic fundamentals in creating a web application. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is quite fun to learn
      tho I may lack in understanding their logics I learned the basics on how to improve.
      
What is something you need to improve on Web Development?
    Something I need to improve is my set of imaginations on how I could play with the blank web page. How i can design and manipulate
    using HTML, CSS, and JS codes I have learned. I will improve on how I organize my codes.
